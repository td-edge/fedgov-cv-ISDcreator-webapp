# Connected Vehicles ISD Creator Webapp Project

## Overview

The fedgov-cv-ISDcreator-webapp project is a webapp that allows a user to define the lanes and approaches of an intersection using a graphical interface. Once designed, the user can encode an ISD, MAP, or SPaT message as an ASN.1 UPER Hex string.

The ISD Creator Tool is accessible at <https://webapp.connectedvcs.com/isd>
